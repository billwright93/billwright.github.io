	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a postdoctoral research assistant in the field of cosmology, working with Tessa Baker at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/astro/">QMUL</a> &mdash; I started in January 2020. But before that, from 2016-2019, I was a PhD student at <a href="http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/">ICG Portsmouth</a> supervised by Kazuya Koyama. And before that, from 2012-2016, I was an MPhys student at Durham &mdash; I did my final-year project with Baojiu Li. You can read more about my research interests on the <a href="/research">Research</a> page.</p>
	<p>Outside of cosmology, I love playing a sport called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)">Ultimate Frisbee</a>. I first picked up Ultimate while at Durham and have competed in tournaments across the UK with various teams; I currently play for Oxford Ultimate Club. I'm a keen reader, mainly of sci-fi and fantasy, but occasionally popular economics and history books too. Finally, I also love cooking, baking, surfing, and computer games.</p>
