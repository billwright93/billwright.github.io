	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>My research mainly focuses on investigating the effects of modified gravity on large-scale structure formation. One approach to studying structure formation is the use of N-body simulations. With collborators at ICG Portsmouth I helped implement modified gravity in an approximate simulation method called COLA. This work resulted in a paper, as well as a code developed by <a href="https://www.wintherscoming.no/">Hans Winther</a> (who is now at Oslo) is <a href="https://github.com/HAWinther/MG-PICOLA-PUBLIC">MG-PICOLA</a>.</p>
