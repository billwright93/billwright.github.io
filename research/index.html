	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>My research mainly focuses on investigating the effects of modified gravity and massive neutrinos on large-scale structure formation, as well as finding ways to break the degeneracy between the two effects.</p>
	<p>One approach to studying structure formation is the use of N-body simulations. With collborators at ICG Portsmouth I helped implement modified gravity in a fast, approximate simulation method called COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration). This work resulted in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00879">arXiv:1703.00879</a>, as well as a code called <a href="https://github.com/HAWinther/MG-PICOLA-PUBLIC">MG-PICOLA</a> developed by <a href="https://www.wintherscoming.no/">Hans Winther</a> (who is now at Oslo).</p>
	<p>Typically, modified gravity enhances structure formation, and this enhancement is a great signal to look out for. However, massive neutrinos suppress structure formation via their free-streaming effect, with heavier neutrinos causing greater suppression. Thus we can have a degeneracy where the large-scale structure in a universe with modified gravity and heavy neutrinos is difficult to distinguish to that of a universe with GR and light neutrinos. To investigate this degeneracy further, we implemented massive neutrinos in MG-PICOLA, resulting in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08165">arXiv:1705.08165</a>.</p>
	<p>One way to break this degeneracy is to use redshift-space distortions; we investigated this possibility in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10692">arXiv:1902.10692</a>.</p>
	<p>The above research makes up the bulk of my PhD thesis, which can be found <a href="https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/modelling-nonlinear-structure-formation-with-modified-gravity-and-massive-neutrinos(64d5bbe6-68de-4a71-a82d-934c6a344670).html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I have also studied the effects of a time-varying strength of gravity on the ability of Type Ia supernovae to act as standard candles in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07018">arXiv:1710.07018</a>; we found that the standardisability could be comprimised in such a scenario. In a follow up paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03066">arXiv:1804.03066</a>), we flipped this idea around to use gravitational wave standard sirens to constrain the time-variation of the strength of gravity.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I'm an active member of the Theory and Simulation Working Groups of the <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/">Euclid Consortium</a>, and the Theory & Joint Probes Working Group of <a href="https://lsstdesc.org/">LSST-DESC</a>.</p>
